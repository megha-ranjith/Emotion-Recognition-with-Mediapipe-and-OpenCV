## **Key Features**  

### 1. **Real-Time Emotion Detection**  
- Utilizes Mediapipe's FaceMesh to identify 468 facial landmarks in real-time.  
- Recognizes emotions like:  
  - Neutral  
  - Happy  
  - Surprised  
  - Angry  

### 2. **Interactive Visualization**  
- Live webcam feed with overlaid facial landmarks.  
- Clear visualization of detected emotions and facial movements.  

### 3. **High Performance**  
- Optimized for real-time processing with minimal lag.  
- Works seamlessly on most systems using just a webcam and Python libraries.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Video Input**  
   - Captures live video using OpenCV.  
2. **Facial Landmark Detection**  
   - Mediapipe FaceMesh detects key points on the face.  
3. **Emotion Analysis**  
   - Calculates distances and angles between landmarks to identify emotions.  
4. **Visual Output**  
   - Displays detected emotions and live landmark overlays on the video feed.
